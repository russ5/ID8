# ID8 - Brainstorming Tool

ID8 is an open-source brainstorming tool that allows for users to create, share, and join privately generated whiteboard workspaces.

This software was made possible with jQuery, Socket.io, shortid, Express, NodeJS, and Bootstrap.

ID8 was created with love by Nick Dal Farra, Daniel Forestell, and Russell Lamey.
